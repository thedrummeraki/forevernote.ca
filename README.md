Implementation of our SEG3525 project at University of Ottawa.

## Sneak Peek

## What is it?
The goal is to develop a note-taking web software. Students are the targetted users for
this platform, although it may be used by anyone. One of our requirements is to work on
simplicity, because lots of note-taking software are too complicated to use or have too
many features/options.

## About
This project is being prepared for our university course *User interfaces* to demonstrate
the principles learned through a high level prototype.

The back-end implementation (all business logic) is not the important part of the project,
so it will not implemented. The emphasis is being made on how user-friendly the system,
the user interactions, etc.

## How to run?
Very simple. All that is needed is Node.js being installed.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/thedrummeraki/seg3525-project.git
$ cd seg3525-project
$ npm install
$ node bin/www
```

The application should run on your ```localhost``` on port ```3000```.

## Screenshots
_Coming soon!_ (That's a promise)

## Is it ready?
__Almost__. The project is due by the end of July 2017. At the time of writing this README,
the project is still being implemented.
